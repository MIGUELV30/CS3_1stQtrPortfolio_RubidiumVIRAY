#  List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
  1.  Loop Control Structures - These are a type of programming constructs that direct the flow of execution based on repetitions or conditions. Examples of these are the if, if-else, for, while and etc. loops
2. Function Declaration: A function is a block of code that is designed to accomplish specific tasks. When a function is needed, it is called in the code, but first must be declared. In order to declare a function, you must follow the syntax: function function-name([argument-list]) { block of code [return] }. However, to call a function, you must follow: “function-name;”.
3. Javascript Operations: These are the basic operations in JS. These include arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment and ternary operators.
4. While statement: This is a type of loop control structure. It allows code to be executed repeatedly WHILE given a boolean condition.
5. For statement: This is also a type of loop control structure. It is similar to the while statement but it has 3 main parts in its syntax: It has initialization of the variable, its very own condition and its increment/decrement of the variable.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. Debugging: I feel like I need lots of practice on this specific topic because finding problems has always not been my strong suit. I feel that it is hard to locate these specific problems and change each one accordingly so that the program can work.
2. For statement: I may have put this in the very well part but I still struggle with this sometimes. The second LT is a prime example of that because it took me a while in order to find the right condition.
3. Converting strings to numeric data: I feel that I find this difficult because the syntax for this is hard to memoize. Its also difficult when you try to input this into a condition like trying to test if the data is string or not.
4. Nested Loop: I don’t find this that much difficult but I lack practice in it. Hopefully, as the SY goes on I gain more experience doing nested loops.
5. Custom and pre-defined functions: I have not yet had much experience with this particular topic. However, I can see this topic being really easy in the future if I keep practicing.
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
My plan of action would be to simply practice coding and study these particular topics more. I say this because more experience will make it easier for me.
# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
Effective: Code Chef: This is effective because its basically short coding quizzes that get harder as you progress. 
Effective: Bonus Activities: Some of these bonus activities really help with practicing and getting more experience overall.
Not Effective: Google Form: I feel that the google form that was supposed to test our understanding didn’t really help (For me).
Not Effective: Activity (?):
